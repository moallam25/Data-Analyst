I'm a data analyst with a strong focus on data cleaning and visualization. I recently worked on a laptop dataset, where I performed extensive data cleaning, handled missing values, removed inconsistencies, and transformed the data for analysis.

I then used Power BI to create interactive visualizations that highlighted trends in pricing, performance specifications, and screen types.

Iâ€™m passionate about turning raw data into insights and always looking to grow my skills in data storytelling and business intelligence.
